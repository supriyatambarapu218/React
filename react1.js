                     Ladies gathered in a group to stay together during tough times of the dust storm, 
                     all in vibrant red traditional Rajasthani costumes. 
                     Balanced in middle of a vertical frame with trees dancing in background to the song of storm.
                      The Energy of nature is felt flowing in this photograph.
                       This is lively, the count of 6 trees balancing the heads of visible 6 ladies and the pattern at which they 
                       all fall in place inside the picture is phenomenal. The Least said the pots in the foreground close to the viewerâ€™s 
                       eye are the x-factor in this picture. It creates the space, the dimension in 3D, a perfect balancing composition to a 
                       masterpiece photograph.</h2>
